# uiLogos Figma plugin

Every now and then, we all need a logo as a placeholder for design and don't have the time to create a dummy logo or Google one. UILogos allows you to quickly insert dummy logos or Brand logos into your design.

I have also included all country flags (194) and selected brand logos. With this plugin, you can quickly insert these logos into Figma or Figjam files. The plugin offers a variety of options.
